TLDR: A PATH isn't a property of your computer - it's just a variable that each shell process maintains separately. Think of it like this:

Your machine has files and folders, but doesn't inherently know what a "PATH" is
Each shell (zsh, bash, etc.) maintains its own PATH variable
When you start a new shell, it builds its PATH by reading config files

So if you have:

- Terminal 1 running zsh
- Terminal 2 running bash
- Terminal 3 running fish

They could all have different PATHs at the same time, because they're separate processes reading different config files. Even two zsh windows could have different PATHs if you modified one's PATH during its session.
The PATH is just each shell's personal "where to look for commands" list, not a system-wide setting.
