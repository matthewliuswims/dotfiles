This is a text file, because I didn't want to create a script file as perhaps only certain commands need to be used. Eventually, this could be more robust.
To use this, just copy the command you want to use and slap it into your terminal.

# to allow sublime to open any file from the CLI (this uses symlinking)
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16199581/open-sublime-text-from-terminal-in-macos
# this requires sublime to be in the applications folder
sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/bin/subl
