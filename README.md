# README

## vim

0. run `vim ~/.vimrc` and copy over the contents of the corresponding dot file in this repo to that file
1. download Vim-Plug via https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
2. Make sure to actually call :PlugInstall while in vim (just literally be in any vim command mode) to install the plugin!!!
3. You should now be able to see a themed vim editor when you use vim

## zshrc

0. install zsh https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH AND....run `vim ~/.zshrc` and copy over the contents of corresponding dot file in this repo to that file
1. install oh-my-zsh via https://ohmyz.sh/#install
2. restart editor, you should now see the icons and commands change color, but for some reason the background doens't change color as per [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14056007).
3. In order to get the dark background, we'll have to change the themes of the actual terminal emulator. You can go to `Settings > Profile > Colors > Color Presets` and choose `Dark Background`
4. You should clearly see oh-my-zsh show up, the dark theme show up, and zsh should also be respected!

## git

- for `gitconfig` add it to to the gitconfig file via `vim ~/.gitconfig`
